# This secret was generated using the following commands (This is for docker hub, for other registries, please refer to the documentation):
# kubectl create secret docker-registry <name-of-secret> --docker-server=https://index.docker.io/v1/ --docker-username=<your-docker-hub-username> --docker-password=<your-docker-hub-password> --docker-email=<your-docker-hub-email>
# docker server is usually always the same for docker hub registry but can be found in the docker config file, do: cat ~/.docker/config.json and you must get something like:
# {
#     "auths": {
#         "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {
#             "auth": "..."
#         }
#     }
# }
# To get the secret in yaml do: kubectl get secret <name-of-secret> --output=yaml
# and then copy the content of the .dockerconfigjson field and paste it in the your secret file

# ATTENTION: I was getting an error where docker was unable to pull the image from docker hub for invalid credentials due to the username not being in lower case, so make sure you use your docker hub username in lower case when creating the secret
# ATTENTION: Do not forget to remove the namespace field from the secret file, otherwise it will not work with osm

# More info for pulling images from private docker hub registry: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/
